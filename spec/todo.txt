todo
    - account for difference in compile.ts and eval.ts
        - primitive functions such as *, -, =, / cannot be treated as valid
          identifier in output js, need to map to operators
        - need type-checking to ensure output js is correct (see 1.)
        - need a target more suitable than js to output to (see 2.)
    - modify formal grammar
        - add (cond ...)
    - implement proper TCO (which is why we can't use js as output)

optional todo
    - re-write project in a language with explicit memory management
      (preferably rust), prototype in ts first.
